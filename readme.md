# Pong, in Godot, using C# because mono

It's an implementation of the cult-classic video-gameboy-PC-playstation game magazine film: the game: the boardgame: on PC: Pong!

Made using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org), but the Mono version, because C# is for big bois and grils.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cptchuckles/godot-pong-mono.git
```

### Prerequisites
 - The Godot Game Engine (Mono)
 - The .NET SDK
   - This project is not suited for the Mono version of MSBuild, because I couldn't be arsed to install that version of C# since .NET Core is the new hotness and mono is old.
 - git
 - a computer
 - fingers
 - chicken tenders

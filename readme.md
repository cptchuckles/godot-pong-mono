# Pong, in Godot, using C# because mono

It's an implementation of the cult-classic video-gameboy-PC-playstation game magazine film: the game: the boardgame: on PC: Pong!

Made using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org) -- the Mono version, because C# is for big bois and grils.
Godot is the engine which renders Unity completely irrelevant and debunked, L + Ratio'd, and on suicide watch.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cptchuckles/godot-pong-mono.git
```

### Prerequisites
 - The Godot Game Engine (Mono)
 - The .NET SDK (or use Mono, but you will have to switch the compiler in project settings)
 - git
 - a computer
 - fingers
 - Arby's chicken tenders (large)
